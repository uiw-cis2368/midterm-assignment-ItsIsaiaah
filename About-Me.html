                <h5>My Life</h5>
                <p>In my family there are 4 of us: my Mother, my 2 sisters, and myself. Amongst my siblings I am the oldest with one sister a year younger and the other being two more years younger. I was born in Pearsall, Tx and lived much of my life in Dilley, Tx with half of that time with my Mom and the other half with my Grandparents. I still live in Dilley and I travel everyday to campus from my house, driving one hour to campus and another hour going back home at the end of the day. My Mother works in town at the Migrant Detention Center that is known as "Core Civic" or "CCA", which was known about a year or two ago for the migrant child who had passed away. My grandfather works as the municipal judge for the city and the Frio County. My grandmother works for the local school at the administration building, doing payroll for everyone in the school district. One of my sisters just started her college adventure at Texas State, pursuing a degree in Zoology. The other sister is still in High School as a junior and is due to graduate in a year and a half, being the last child in the family to graduate from High School.</p>

                <h5>EMS Career</h5>
                <p>I started my EMS career back in the beginning of my senior year when I was made aware of an EMT-B program that was being offered. I learned how to treat multiple kinds of incidents, did proper training on how to use certain pieces of equipement, was tested on my ability to diagnosed someone's illness, how to treat it, and the procedure on treatment and transporting to the nearest hospital. I did work on an ambulance for two companies and treated around 30-40 people in Pearsall, Devine, Natalia, and Uvalde. I was also fortunate to work in the ED (Emergency Department) at a hospital in Pearsall, Tx with some pretty amazing nurses. At the hospital I treated around 50 or so patient's ranging from acute illness to DKA and some women going into labor.</p>

                <h5>College Education</h5>
                <p>In High School, my district had teamed up with the local junior college, SWTJC in Uvalde, to offer dual credit courses to students so they would be able to gain college hours and graduate with their associates along with their High School Diploma. I was fortunate enough to be part of that program and I graduated from college before I did from my high school.</p>
              </div>
              <p>I had applied to only 3 colleges, with my main one being UT Austin but I was turned down because of the grade for one of my math classes. The second school was Texas State University but I never heard back from them after sending in my application so I had applied here. The main reason why I applied here was because of the scholarship that I was offered, however I was not sure what major to choose so I randomly chose Cyber Security Systems since I felt I was rather well informed on technology. Boy was I wrong because the first semester here, everyone in my class had a deeper understanding than I did which made it a bit more challenging since technically I was playing catch up. Right now I am a sophmore on campus and I have almost all of my core curriculum out of the way, which has me identified as a Senior. >:)</p>
